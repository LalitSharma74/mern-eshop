# E-Commerce Backend
This E-Commerce backend has the API routes that point to each of the standard [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) operations for each data group. The routes can be used to:
- Create categories, products, tags
- Fully functional Authentication workflow ðŸ”’
- View categories, products, tags
- Establish associations between the different entities
- Update categories, products, & tags
- Delete entries from the database

All that's missing to make this a complete E-Commerce website is a simple front-end application that makes calls to the API routes that are already built-in. If that's too much, simply try making requests to the API routes from your browser to the see the raw data that's returned.

The server is running, now you can make requests to it through your desired method. If you're new to the backend, I suggest trying out [Postman](postman.com)
